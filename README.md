# 👋 Hey there, I'm Manju!

Welcome to my **portfolio** – a digital garage of the stuff I've built, broken, fixed, and had fun with.

---

## 🚀 Who am I?

I'm a **developer**, **machine learning explorer**, and part-time **debug therapist** (because sometimes code just needs a good cry). My interests span across:

- 🤖 **Artificial Intelligence** – Making machines think (but not too hard, we don’t want Skynet).
- 🧠 **Machine Learning & Deep Learning** – Building models that can predict stuff better than my mood on a Monday.
- 🧹 **Data Engineering** – Cleaning and moving data around like Marie Kondo for CSVs.
- 🌐 **Full Stack Development** – Because I like my code like I like my coffee: end-to-end.

## 🛠️ What’s in this repo?

This portfolio isn’t just a boring list of links – it’s a showcase of projects that reflect:
- **What I’ve built** (from intelligent agents to full-stack dashboards),
- **What I’m curious about** (hint: it usually involves some AI wizardry), and
- **What I’m still learning** (because honestly, who isn’t?).

Projects include:
- 🧭 *Carbon Compass*: Personalized carbon footprint insights powered by AI.
- 📰 *RSS Aggregator in Go*: Minimalist, nerdy, and surprisingly fast.
- 🤖 *LLM Integrations*: Making large language models do cool tricks without breaking the bank.
- 📊 *Data + UI Dashboards*: Query, analyze, visualize – repeat.

## 💭 Philosophy

I believe in writing **code that works, then code that’s clean, then code that’s kinda pretty**.

## 🧪 Currently Playing With

- ✨ Fine-tuning LLMs with custom datasets
- 🧠 CNNs and ViTs for image-based tasks
- 🔄 Kafka + Airflow for event-driven data pipelines
- 🧪 Experimenting with model evaluation + guardrails

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Solve real-world problems with AI.
- Build systems that don’t fall apart on Fridays.
- Work with teams that love tech as much as memes.
- Help others get started in ML & Data Engineering (yes, DMs are open 👋).
